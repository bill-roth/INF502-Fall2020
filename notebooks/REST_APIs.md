# Using REST APIs as data sources

* Data is everywhere and it is generated constantly
* The number of datasources is amazingly huge
* Datasets are huge and can be used in many ways

* We may do amazing things using data made available by third-party:
    - https://developer.walmartlabs.com/docs
    - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
    - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/
    
    
We will have a nice and brief overview about how to consume data from REST APIs, mainly focusing on **JSON**.


### What is an API?

**Application Programming Interface** defines the methods for one software program to interact with the other. 

In the case of this lecture, we are dealing with a REST API, which sends data over a network: one type of Web service.

When we want to receive data from an Web service, we need to make a `request` to this service. When the server receives this request, it sends a `response`.

### Requests

Knowing that, we will not have to learn about making requests in Python

We do it by importing the module requests


```python
import requests
```

There are different types of requests. 

In our case we will use a `GET`, which is used to retrieve data. This is the type of request we use to collect data.

A response from the API contains 2 things (among others): 
* response code
* response data

To make a request, we use:


```python
response = requests.get('http://www.nau.edu/')
type(response)
```




    requests.models.Response



The `request.get(URL)` returns an object Response, which provides, among other things, the response code.


```python
response.status_code
```




    200



THe most common codes are:
* 200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).
* 301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.
* 400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.
* 401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.
* 403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right permissions to see it.
* 404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.
* 503: The server is not ready to handle the request.

More details about status codes list can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

### What about getting the data?

First, read the documentation! Everytime you use an API, please read the documentation to understand how to use, the structure, etc.

We will use the [Open Notify API](http://api.open-notify.org/), which gives access to data about the international space station.

These APIs usually provide multiple endpoints, which are the ways we can interact with that service.

Let's try a request and see how it goes:


```python
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
print(response.status_code)
```

    200


Now we can see the data...


```python
type(response.content)
```




    bytes




```python
response.text
```




    '{"message": "success", "people": [{"name": "Sergey Ryzhikov", "craft": "ISS"}, {"name": "Kate Rubins", "craft": "ISS"}, {"name": "Sergey Kud-Sverchkov", "craft": "ISS"}], "number": 3}'




```python
response.json()
```




    {'message': 'success',
     'people': [{'name': 'Sergey Ryzhikov', 'craft': 'ISS'},
      {'name': 'Kate Rubins', 'craft': 'ISS'},
      {'name': 'Sergey Kud-Sverchkov', 'craft': 'ISS'}],
     'number': 3}



### Working with JSON 
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a way to encode data structures that ensures that they are easily readable. 

JSON output look like Python something with *dictionaries, lists, strings* and *integers*. And it is...

But, how to use it? Well, we used it in the last command.



```python
import json
```

json has two main functions:

* `json.dumps()` — Takes in a Python object and converts (dumps) to a string.
* `json.loads()` — Takes a JSON string and converts (loads) to a Python object.

The `dumps()` is particularly useful as we can use it to format the json, making it easier to understand the output


```python
json_response = response.json()
formatted_json = json.dumps(json_response, sort_keys=True, indent=3
                           )

print(formatted_json)
```

    {
       "message": "success",
       "number": 3,
       "people": [
          {
             "craft": "ISS",
             "name": "Sergey Ryzhikov"
          },
          {
             "craft": "ISS",
             "name": "Kate Rubins"
          },
          {
             "craft": "ISS",
             "name": "Sergey Kud-Sverchkov"
          }
       ]
    }


### REST API with Query Parameters

In some cases, it is possible to pass parameters to filter the output of the API. 

The http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json endpoint tells the next times that the international space station will pass over a given location on the earth.

It requires parameters


```python
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json")
print("RESPONSE CODE:" + str(response.status_code))
print(response.json())

```

    RESPONSE CODE:400
    {'message': 'failure', 'reason': 'Latitude must be specified'}


Let's read the docs: 
* http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times/


```python
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=35.1983&lon=111.6513")
print("RESPONSE CODE:" + str(response.status_code))
print(response.json())
#35.1983, 111.6513
```

    RESPONSE CODE:200
    {'message': 'success', 'request': {'altitude': 100, 'datetime': 1603836506, 'latitude': 35.1983, 'longitude': 111.6513, 'passes': 5}, 'response': [{'duration': 390, 'risetime': 1603841584}, {'duration': 520, 'risetime': 1603847415}, {'duration': 648, 'risetime': 1603853197}, {'duration': 542, 'risetime': 1603859036}, {'duration': 479, 'risetime': 1603907545}]}



```python
formatted_json = json.dumps(response.json(), sort_keys=False, indent=2)
#print(formatted_json)
print(response.json()["response"][0]["risetime"])
```

    1603841584


#### Let’s deal with the pass times from our JSON object

Reading the docs (and looking at our JSON), we can see what we need to do


```python
times = []

for item in response.json()['response']:
    times.append(item['risetime'])
    
print(times)
```

    [1603841584, 1603847415, 1603853197, 1603859036, 1603907545]



```python
from datetime import datetime

datetime.fromtimestamp(times[0]).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S")
```




    '2020-10-27 04:33:04'




```python
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls")
pulls = response.json()
print(json.dumps(pulls, indent=2))
```

I want the proxy to cache dynamic content from the origin, but when a client revalidates a resource, I want the proxy to revalidate the public content with the origin too, and not the private authenticated responses. I found currently Nginx never revalidates with the origin server. It just gets a new copy of the resource whenever it thinks it needs one.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be the most immediate way of doing so is to modify the configuration in config/application.rb like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_dispatch.default_headers.merge!('Cache-Control' => 'proxy-revalidate')\r\n```\r\nThe proxy-revalidate in the cached response should be enough for nginx to trigger a revalidate when receiving a request. Proxy-revalidate header can be used on a response to an authenticated request to permit the user's cache to store and later return the response without needing to revalidate it, since it has already been authenticated once by that user, while still requiring proxies that service many users to revalidate each time in order to make sure that each user has been authenticated. Note that such authenticated responses also need the public cache control directive in order to allow them to be cached at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a general description of the code changes in your pull\r\nrequest... were there any bugs you had fixed?

I have written a failing test and made it pass.\r\n\r\n### How did we fix it?\r\nThe problem was that when we using time_instance.to_f  - this was not accurate enough in certain cases. I have attempted to solve it by ensuring that we use Rationals when creating Time instances time_instance.to_r . (there is a slight performance cost to this, but the benefit is accuracy). \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing and I hope this helps.\r\n\r\nrgds,\r\nBen\r\n\r\n",

We use both approaches extensively at GitHub.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is controlled by the `render_test_selectors` configuration flag, which defaults to `false`. It's expected that developers will set the flag to `true` in development and test.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Nikka Padilla <nixpad@github.com>",

Instead you *can choose to use* `has_secure_password` on second column (`recovery_password` is [suggested in the `ActiveMode::SecurePassword` docs][1] [since 2018][2]) and disable validations so it can be null by default until a user asks for recovery password at which point your own application logic will need to generate at least the plain text version of that recovery password before SecurePassword creates a bcrypt digest.\r\n\r\nThere was also an disingenuous suggestion in the paragraph that `has_secure_password` has \"similar features\" to Devise and Auth Logic. That's just not true. It's definitely simpler and lighter weight, so I cut down the unnecessarily long activation code example, explained what basic features `has_secure_password` *does* support, and linked to the API documentation for `has_secure_password` to avoid making the guide excessively dependent on the current API of the module.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/olivierlacan/rails/blob/533c5c3a532a01ca5ae6ddd3f04137b13e9271ab/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L44\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e62e68e25bb7b1281e20e228db66f7deace4330f",

If so, mention them. If\r\nthese bugs have open GitHub issues, be sure to tag them here as well,\r\nto keep the conversation linked together. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there's anything else that's important and relevant to your pull\r\nrequest, mention that information here. This could include\r\nbenchmarks, or other information.\r\n\r\nIf you are updating any of the CHANGELOG files or are asked to update the\r\nCHANGELOG files by reviewers, please add the CHANGELOG entry at the top of the file.\r\n\r\nFinally, if your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to Rails! -->\r\n",

That is because `crossorigin` in the `link` header[ preload ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)directive and on the resource itself need to match in order for browsers to re-use a resource.\r\n\r\nFor example if you use this tag in a view:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= javascript_include_tag(\"[...snip]react.production.min.js\", crossorigin: \"anonymous\") %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`javascript_include_tag` pushes that resource to the link http header, but currently ignores the `crossorigin` attribute.\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the above-mentioned double fetches:\r\n<img width=\"1618\" alt=\"double fetches in network tab chrome\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/474248/96795533-778ec200-13cd-11eb-9f11-b543a81aea85.png\">\r\n\r\nChrome even provides a warning for these cases:\r\n<img width=\"1613\" alt=\"chrome warning\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/474248/96795717-81b0c080-13cd-11eb-898e-af142e75aae6.png\">\r\n\r\n> A preload for 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/17.0.0/umd/react.production.min.js' is found, but is not used because the request credentials mode does not match. Consider taking a look at crossorigin attribute.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it so that the link header directives include the same `crossorigin` values as those that have been passed to the resources themselves, which allows browsers to reuse the preloaded resource. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1616\" alt=\"double fetches fixed chrome network tab\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/474248/96795590-7a89b280-13cd-11eb-8f61-cd13f9412c9a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n`crossorigin: true` producing  `anonymous` has already been done [in the existing `https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/57dd21ef65f8c4ff8f847b04133b17c5f01d6ed7/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper.rb#L281`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/57dd21ef65f8c4ff8f847b04133b17c5f01d6ed7/actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper.rb#L281) helper, so I replicated this behavior here, too.\r\n\r\n",

This could be largely reduced, the compression flag could be just one byte for instance.\r\n>  - If you `MemCacheStore` with the default config, values are serialized and compressed several times `ZLib.deflate(Marshal.Dump(Entry.new(ZLib.deflate(Marshal.dump(actual_value)))))`, that is just wasted compute.\r\n>  - I found and read https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9494, apparently there was an attempt to improve things a few years ago, but it was reverted to preserve backward / forward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n[As shown by this benchmark](https://gist.github.com/casperisfine/2b67492c83c259d5a1160cc2b74dd91b), the minimum entry size is down from `112B` to `23B`.\r\n\r\nThe deserialization of an empty payload is `~1.64x` faster, and serialization `~1.88x` faster.\r\n\r\nOf course that advantage quickly drop as the entry gets bigger, and the deserialization of the payload dwarfs the deserialization of the enveloppe. But deserialization stay slightly faster (`~1.12x`), likely because we avoid the \"marshal in marshal\" issue.\r\n\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nNow that the coders are swappable, we can keep the old behavior just fine, until you use `load_defaults '6.1'` or set the configuration field individually.\r\n\r\nAlso both the `LegacyCoder` and the `EntryCoder` are able to detect payloads serialized with Marshal, hence the transition can be done without flushing the cache stores.\r\n\r\ncc @eugeneius as you reviewed the previous parts\r\ncc @rafaelfranca @etiennebarrie \r\n",

In the spirit of simplifying this PR and trying to get it merged, I've changed this PR to just be the association side of things, and moved the attributes work into another one that I'll open shortly. We're down to this PR just being this API:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Blog < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :categories\r\n\r\n  scope :large_id, -> { where(arel_table[:id].gt(100)) }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :blog\r\n  has_many :posts\r\n\r\n  scope :small_id, -> { where(arel_table[:id].lt(100)) }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :category\r\n  has_many :comments\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can call:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nBlog.large_id.categories.small_id.posts.comments \r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gives you:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"comments\".* FROM \"comments\" WHERE \"comments\".\"post_id\" IN (\r\n  SELECT \"posts\".\"id\" FROM \"posts\" WHERE \"posts\".\"category_id\" IN (\r\n    SELECT \"categories\".\"id\" FROM \"categories\" WHERE \"categories\".\"blog_id\" IN (\r\n      SELECT \"blogs\".\"id\" FROM \"blogs\" WHERE \"blogs\".\"id\" > 100\r\n    ) AND \"categories\".\"id\" < 100\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease take a look and let me know what y'all think about the proposed API. Happy to change/improve anything.",

I didn't know what else to add besides the small unit test I added. It's been a while since I contributed here, so my apologies if there are things that are missing. I will gladly provide any additional information requested.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there's anything else that's important and relevant to your pull\r\nrequest, mention that information here.

In our case, it was when using a `scope` that itself had something to the effect of:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Profile < ApplicationRecord\r\n  belongs_to :user\r\n\r\n  scope :recently_updated, -> { where(arel_table[:updated_at].gteq(7.days.ago)).order(updated_at: :desc) }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_one :profile\r\n\r\n  scope :recently_updated, -> { joins(:profile).merge(Profile.recently_updated) }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe wanted to use `User.recently_updated`, but needed to put a specific group of users at the top of the list. The only way to do that without something like `preorder` would be to reimplement the `recently_updated` scopes defined on the model.\r\n\r\nWith `preorder`, we can simply call `User.recently_updated.preorder('...')`, and we're done!\r\n\r\nAnother way we could use this would be in conjunction with [`ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#ordered_relation`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d83ee61dc6b5e73dd2853c5af9681e71c0150e30/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb#L578-L588):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass CustomerLegalEntity < ApplicationRecord\r\n  scope :ordered, -> { ordered_relation.preorder(default: :desc) }\r\nend\r\n```",

Threads running during a `fork` can leave memory and resources open and potentially cause leaks or deadlocks.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reaper thread in ActiveRecord cannot orphan any resources or memory, and will be cleaned up after forking. \r\n\r\nSetting this thread local variable allows Puma and other application servers to ignore this thread for the purpose of displaying warnings to users about threads present and running during `fork`.\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nI'm open to a different name. I just picked the first one that came out of the ether.\r\n\r\nBecause Rails doesn't consume this thread-local, I did not add a test.\r\n",

### Let's play: your turn

Look at this API:
* https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

I want you to 
1. use filters to get the earthquakes from the previous 60 days, with magnitude between 5.8 and 7.
2. print the place, date, and magnitude of each of them
3. find the highest magnitude
4. using the ISS API, show when the satelite will go through the place where the earthquake with the highest magnitude happened



```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json")
print("RESPONSE CODE:" + str(response.status_code))
print(response.json())
```

    RESPONSE CODE:400
    {'message': 'failure', 'reason': 'Latitude must be specified'}



```python
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

response = requests.get("https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-08-27&maxmagnitude=7&minmagnitude=5.8")
json_response = response.json()
formatted_json = json.dumps(json_response, sort_keys=False, indent=2)

print(formatted_json)
```
