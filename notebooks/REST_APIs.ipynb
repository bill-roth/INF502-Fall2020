      "    \"body\": \"### Summary\\r\\nI have an Nginx reverse proxy on the same machine as my origin server. I want the proxy to cache dynamic content from the origin, but when a client revalidates a resource, I want the proxy to revalidate the public content with the origin too, and not the private authenticated responses. I found currently Nginx never revalidates with the origin server. It just gets a new copy of the resource whenever it thinks it needs one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat appears to be the most immediate way of doing so is to modify the configuration in config/application.rb like so:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nconfig.action_dispatch.default_headers.merge!('Cache-Control' => 'proxy-revalidate')\\r\\n```\\r\\nThe proxy-revalidate in the cached response should be enough for nginx to trigger a revalidate when receiving a request. Proxy-revalidate header can be used on a response to an authenticated request to permit the user's cache to store and later return the response without needing to revalidate it, since it has already been authenticated once by that user, while still requiring proxies that service many users to revalidate each time in order to make sure that each user has been authenticated. Note that such authenticated responses also need the public cache control directive in order to allow them to be cached at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- Provide a general description of the code changes in your pull\\r\\nrequest... were there any bugs you had fixed?

I have written a failing test and made it pass.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How did we fix it?\\r\\nThe problem was that when we using time_instance.to_f  - this was not accurate enough in certain cases. I have attempted to solve it by ensuring that we use Rationals when creating Time instances time_instance.to_r .

We use both approaches extensively at GitHub.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior is controlled by the `render_test_selectors` configuration flag, which defaults to `false`. It's expected that developers will set the flag to `true` in development and test.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-authored-by: Nikka Padilla <nixpad@github.com>\",\n",

Instead you *can choose to use* `has_secure_password` on second column (`recovery_password` is [suggested in the `ActiveMode::SecurePassword` docs][1] [since 2018][2]) and disable validations so it can be null by default until a user asks for recovery password at which point your own application logic will need to generate at least the plain text version of that recovery password before SecurePassword creates a bcrypt digest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was also an disingenuous suggestion in the paragraph that `has_secure_password` has \\\"similar features\\\" to Devise and Auth Logic. That's just not true. It's definitely simpler and lighter weight, so I cut down the unnecessarily long activation code example, explained what basic features `has_secure_password` *does* support, and linked to the API documentation for `has_secure_password` to avoid making the guide excessively dependent on the current API of the module.\\r\\n\\r\\n[1]: https://github.com/olivierlacan/rails/blob/533c5c3a532a01ca5ae6ddd3f04137b13e9271ab/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L44\\r\\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e62e68e25bb7b1281e20e228db66f7deace4330f\",\n",

If so, mention them. If\\r\\nthese bugs have open GitHub issues, be sure to tag them here as well,\\r\\nto keep the conversation linked together. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- If there's anything else that's important and relevant to your pull\\r\\nrequest, mention that information here.

That is because `crossorigin` in the `link` header[ preload ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content)directive and on the resource itself need to match in order for browsers to re-use a resource.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example if you use this tag in a view:\\r\\n\\r\\n```erb\\r\\n<%= javascript_include_tag(\\\"[...snip]react.production.min.js\\\", crossorigin: \\\"anonymous\\\") %>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n`javascript_include_tag` pushes that resource to the link http header, but currently ignores the `crossorigin` attribute.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich leads to the above-mentioned double fetches:\\r\\n<img width=\\\"1618\\\" alt=\\\"double fetches in network tab chrome\\\" src=\\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/474248/96795533-778ec200-13cd-11eb-9f11-b543a81aea85.png\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nChrome even provides a warning for these cases:\\r\\n<img width=\\\"1613\\\" alt=\\\"chrome warning\\\" src=\\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/474248/96795717-81b0c080-13cd-11eb-898e-af142e75aae6.png\\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n> A preload for 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/17.0.0/umd/react.production.min.js' is found, but is not used because the request credentials mode does not match.

This could be largely reduced, the compression flag could be just one byte for instance.\\r\\n>  - If you `MemCacheStore` with the default config, values are serialized and compressed several times `ZLib.deflate(Marshal.Dump(Entry.new(ZLib.deflate(Marshal.dump(actual_value)))))`, that is just wasted compute.\\r\\n>  - I found and read https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9494, apparently there was an attempt to improve things a few years ago, but it was reverted to preserve backward / forward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance\\r\\n\\r\\n[As shown by this benchmark](https://gist.github.com/casperisfine/2b67492c83c259d5a1160cc2b74dd91b), the minimum entry size is down from `112B` to `23B`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deserialization of an empty payload is `~1.64x` faster, and serialization `~1.88x` faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course that advantage quickly drop as the entry gets bigger, and the deserialization of the payload dwarfs the deserialization of the enveloppe. But deserialization stay slightly faster (`~1.12x`), likely because we avoid the \\\"marshal in marshal\\\" issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Backward compatibility\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the coders are swappable, we can keep the old behavior just fine, until you use `load_defaults '6.1'` or set the configuration field individually.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso both the `LegacyCoder` and the `EntryCoder` are able to detect payloads serialized with Marshal, hence the transition can be done without flushing the cache stores.\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @eugeneius as you reviewed the previous parts\\r\\ncc @rafaelfranca @etiennebarrie \\r\\n\",\n",

We're down to this PR just being this API:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nclass Blog < ActiveRecord::Base\\r\\n  has_many :categories\\r\\n\\r\\n  scope :large_id, -> { where(arel_table[:id].gt(100)) }\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\nclass Category < ActiveRecord::Base\\r\\n  belongs_to :blog\\r\\n  has_many :posts\\r\\n\\r\\n  scope :small_id, -> { where(arel_table[:id].lt(100)) }\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\\r\\n  belongs_to :category\\r\\n  has_many :comments\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\\r\\n  belongs_to :post\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you can call:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nBlog.large_id.categories.small_id.posts.comments \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich gives you:\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\nSELECT \\\"comments\\\".* FROM \\\"comments\\\" WHERE \\\"comments\\\".\\\"post_id\\\" IN (\\r\\n  SELECT \\\"posts\\\".\\\"id\\\" FROM \\\"posts\\\" WHERE \\\"posts\\\".\\\"category_id\\\" IN (\\r\\n    SELECT \\\"categories\\\".\\\"id\\\" FROM \\\"categories\\\" WHERE \\\"categories\\\".\\\"blog_id\\\" IN (\\r\\n      SELECT \\\"blogs\\\".\\\"id\\\" FROM \\\"blogs\\\" WHERE \\\"blogs\\\".\\\"id\\\" > 100\\r\\n    ) AND \\\"categories\\\".\\\"id\\\" < 100\\r\\n  )\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease take a look and let me know what y'all think about the proposed API.

In our case, it was when using a `scope` that itself had something to the effect of:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nclass Profile < ApplicationRecord\\r\\n  belongs_to :user\\r\\n\\r\\n  scope :recently_updated, -> { where(arel_table[:updated_at].gteq(7.days.ago)).order(updated_at: :desc) }\\r\\nend\\r\\n\\r\\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\\r\\n  has_one :profile\\r\\n\\r\\n  scope :recently_updated, -> { joins(:profile).merge(Profile.recently_updated) }\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wanted to use `User.recently_updated`, but needed to put a specific group of users at the top of the list. The only way to do that without something like `preorder` would be to reimplement the `recently_updated` scopes defined on the model.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith `preorder`, we can simply call `User.recently_updated.preorder('...')`, and we're done!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother way we could use this would be in conjunction with [`ActiveRecord::FinderMethods#ordered_relation`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d83ee61dc6b5e73dd2853c5af9681e71c0150e30/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/finder_methods.rb#L578-L588):\\r\\n\\r\\n```ruby\\r\\nclass CustomerLegalEntity < ApplicationRecord\\r\\n  scope :ordered, -> { ordered_relation.preorder(default: :desc) }\\r\\nend\\r\\n```\",\n",

Threads running during a `fork` can leave memory and resources open and potentially cause leaks or deadlocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Reaper thread in ActiveRecord cannot orphan any resources or memory, and will be cleaned up after forking. \\r\\n\\r\\nSetting this thread local variable allows Puma and other application servers to ignore this thread for the purpose of displaying warnings to users about threads present and running during `fork`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Other Information\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm open to a different name. I just picked the first one that came out of the ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Rails doesn't consume this thread-local, I did not add a test.\\r\\n\",\n",
